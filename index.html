            <h3>Imagine Your Reality, December 2009.</h3>
            <p>When I first moved to VA, I started working as a partner at Barbella Digital, Inc., but was first contracting with them on a 1099 basis. I used the Overmortal brand as the subcontracting name. The contents of <a href="https://archive.org/details/imagine-your-reality-interview-with-michael-szul">this interview</a> are about past work, as well as work under BDI.</p>
            <h3>Nights with Alice Cooper. October 2004.</h3>
            <p>My very early years on the Internet were spent making posts about the paranormal before the term "blog" was even coined. The web site (madghoul.com) had a more personal narrative that was partly inspired by the television show <a href="http://www.gmdstudios.com/weblab/freakylinks/">Freakylinks</a>.</p>
            <p>In the Summer of 2004, I received an email from one of the people at Nights with Alice Cooper asking me to do an interview. A copy of the interview can be found on <a href="https://archive.org/details/NightsWithAliceCooper-InterviewWithMichaelSzul">Archive.org</a>.</p>
