          <p>I have spent almost two decades in software engineering in industries as diverse as insurance, energy, travel, and higher education, including consulting with companies such as AIG and Conde Naste. I have worked in both application and product development, as well as framework creation, code generation, API building, and machine learning. Currently, I am the principal software engineer for the University of Virginia's School of Medicine.</p>
          <p>I am the co-host of the <a href="https://codepunk.io/tag/podcast/" rel="external">Codepunk</a> podcast--a podcast about programming, technology, and the digital lifestyle, which has encompassed such topics as data visualization, artificial intelligence, JavaScript/TypeScript, and .NET programming. In addition, I record programming tutorials on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mjszul" rel="external">YouTube</a> with the first series about building chatbots with Microsoft's Bot Framework and natural language processing tools (including Azure Cognitive Services such as LUIS). I also edit an email newsletter called <a href="http://botsandbeer.com" rel="external">Bots + Beer</a>.</p>
          <p>In October of 2017, I became a Microsoft MVP for Visual Studio and Development Technologies.</p>
          <p>I have a bachelor's degree in psychology and a master's degree in clinical psychology with an applied research specialization.</p>
          <p>I blog about technology, programming, and cybercultural at <a href="http://codepunk.io" rel="external">Codepunk</a>.</p>
