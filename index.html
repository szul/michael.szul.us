              <dt>edUi Conference 2016. "The New JavaScript and How it Will Change the Way You Design and Develop." October 24th 2016.</dt>
              <dd>Summary: <em>"Learn how the University of Virginia School of Medicine has used JavaScript tooling and transpilers to completely rebuild the educational testing software for medical students. JavaScript has been dominant in recent years because of how well it works in mobile and responsive environments, but it has always lacked in two areas: tooling and browser compatibility. Whereas jQuery made JavaScript and client-side programming accessible to designers and content managers, new tooling such as Grunt, Gulp, Brunch, Bower, Yeoman, etc. have allowed DevOps to move to the frontend, while transpilers such as Babel, Traceur, TypeScript, Less, and Sass have created supersets of the web-based languages frontend developers use on a daily basis in order to produce efficient, scalable, powerful, and cross-browser compatible web applications."</em></dd>

Sample application and scripts will be demonstrated and available on GitHub for download."</em></dd>

            <h3>Imagine Your Reality, December 2009.</h3>
            <p>When I first moved to VA, I started working as a partner at Barbella Digital, Inc., but was first contracting with them on a 1099 basis. I used the Overmortal brand as the subcontracting name. The contents of <a href="https://archive.org/details/imagine-your-reality-interview-with-michael-szul">this interview</a> are about past work, as well as work under BDI.</p>
            <h3>Nights with Alice Cooper. October 2004.</h3>
            <p>My very early years on the Internet were spent making posts about the paranormal before the term "blog" was even coined. The web site (madghoul.com) had a more personal narrative that was partly inspired by the television show <a href="http://www.gmdstudios.com/weblab/freakylinks/">Freakylinks</a>.</p>
            <p>In the Summer of 2004, I received an email from one of the people at Nights with Alice Cooper asking me to do an interview. A copy of the interview can be found on <a href="https://archive.org/details/NightsWithAliceCooper-InterviewWithMichaelSzul">Archive.org</a>.</p>
