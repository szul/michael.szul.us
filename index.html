          <h1>Michael Szul</h1>
          <p>Since 1998, I have developed software for large, established companies like AIG and Conde Naste, as well as fast growing start-ups like Performance Media Group, in roles ranging from senior programmer to director of development.

Currently, I am the lead programmer for the University of Virginia’s School of Medicine.</p>
          <p>I have a bachelor's degree in psychology and a master's degree in clinical psychology with an applied research specialization.</p>
          <p>I blog about technology, programming, and cybercultural at <a href="http://codepunk.io" rel="external">codepunk.io</a> and occasionally post about other topics at <a href="http://overmortal.com" rel="external">overmortal</a>.</p>

          <h3>Nights with Alice Cooper. October 2004.</h3>
          <p>My very early years on the Internet were spent making posts about the <strong>paranormal</strong> before the term "blog" was even coined. I used to help out Norman Williams of New Jersey Paranormal Investigations (NJPI) with various cases. Those cases combined with other <strong>paranormal experiences</strong> inspired me to create a web site (originally called The Midknight Club) that eventually morphed into <strong>The Mad Ghoul</strong> (or madghoul.com). The switch to madghoul.com and a more personal narrative was partly inspired by the television show <a href="http://www.gmdstudios.com/weblab/freakylinks/">Freakylinks</a>.</p>
          <p>In the Summer of 2004, I received an email from one of the people at Nights with Alice Cooper asking me to do an interview. A copy of the interview can be found on <a href="https://archive.org/details/NightsWithAliceCooper-InterviewWithMichaelSzul">Archive.org</a>.</p>
          <h3>Imagine Your Reality, December 2009.</h3>
          <p>When I first moved to VA, I started working as a partner at Barbella Digital, Inc., but was first contracting with them on a 1099 basis. I used the Overmortal brand as the subcontracting name. The contents of <a href="https://archive.org/details/imagine-your-reality-interview-with-michael-szul">this interview</a> are about past work, as well as work under BDI, but masqueraded as Overmortal at the time because of issues with a previous employer.</p>
